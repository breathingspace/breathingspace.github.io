title: about james' dev blog
---

This is a small blog I started writing on in early 2024 as a place to dump thoughts about code and other projects that I or other people have written.

You can read about projects I've worked on [here](./projects) or look through some of my contributions on [Github](https://github.com/jamesgwyer).
